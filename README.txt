QR Code Scanner using OpenCV and PyZbar

This project aims to implement a simple QR code scanner application using Python. It utlizes libraries such as OpenCV, PyZbar, and Tkinter. The program allows users to either select an image containing a QR code or start a live video feed to detect and process QR codes in real-time.

How to Run the Code:
1. Download the ipynb file named (qr.ipynb).
2. Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Navigate to the directory where the files are.
4. Open qr.ipynb notebook file.
5. Run the notebook cells containing the code.
6. Select either 'Select File' or 'Start Video Capture'.
7. If 'Select File' was selected, insert a image containing a QR code.
8. If 'Start Video Capture', show an image containing a QR code to the webcm.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x.x
- Numpy (comes with Anaconda)
- OpenCV
- PyZbar
- Tkinter (built-in)
- PIL
- Webbrowser (built-in)
- Threading (built-in)

File Structure
- qr.ipynb: Jupyter Notebppk containing the code 
- README.txt: Documentation file explaining the project and how to run the code.
